# Overview

This is a special GitHub repository. Placing specifically named files in specifically named places causes specific effects in the [ICI3D organizational page](https://github.com/orgs/ICI3D). See [the documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations) for more details; particularly [this bit](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile) for GH profile view.

This repository is public: we generally prefer to make our institutional materials publicly available. Part of the mission of ICI3D is to incubation new workshops, clinics, etc and as such, we strive to make all our organizing elements also publicly available.

However, some materials are access sensitive. While we *never* put any access keys in repositories, some of the processes for using those keys (e.g. how to engage with domain hosting and so on) expose information that could be combined with other purloined data to mess with the organization. To ward that off, there is also a private repository for members-only-management information.

In addition to the GH-specific structural files, we also use this repository to document techniques, procedures, policy, etc for working with the organization's GH presence:
 - [Teams](#teams)
 - [TODO](#todo)

# Teams

## Motivation

ICI3D organizes along two primary dimensions: *Functional* teams and *Activity* teams. *Functional* teams represent functions within the overall organization; *Activity* teams correspond to particular offerings of ICI3D, _e.g._ a workshop like MMED.

The *Functional* teams have indefinite lifetimes, though somewhat regularly changing composition. The *Activity* teams are associated with the "next" offering of that activity (or the most recent offering, while post-event feedback / updates / etc occur). Both kinds of teams are persistent, but in general *Activity* teams are reset once post-event work is wrapped - that means basically the membership roster is deleted, and leadership / management folks should be turned over to the next event team.
